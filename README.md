Project Overview:
This project focuses on the segmentation of water bodies from satellite imagery using advanced deep learning techniques. By utilizing PyTorch and TorchGeo, we have developed a model capable of accurately identifying and segmenting water bodies in multispectral raster images.

Key Features:
Utilization of PyTorch and TorchGeo for high-performance geospatial computation.
Curated dataset of multispectral raster images, paired with ground truth masks to enhance data integrity.
Implementation of Instance Segmentation using the DeepLabV3 model.
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.6% in water body segmentation.
